# neural-networks
A hands-on implementation of foundational neural network concepts—from single neurons to multi-layer networks—for both classification and regression tasks. Built from scratch in NumPy, this project covers forward propagation, activation functions, loss computation (log loss &amp; MSE), and architectural adaptations for different prediction tasks.
